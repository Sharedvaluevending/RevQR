## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Spin Wheels Table
CREATE TABLE spin_wheels (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    business_id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    wheel_type ENUM('campaign', 'machine', 'qr_standalone') DEFAULT 'campaign',
    campaign_id INT NULL,
    machine_name VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    qr_code_id INT NULL,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Updated Rewards Table
ALTER TABLE rewards ADD COLUMN spin_wheel_id INT NULL;

-- Updated Spin Results Table  
ALTER TABLE spin_results ADD COLUMN spin_wheel_id INT NULL;
```

### URL Structure
- **Public Spin Wheel**: `/public/spin-wheel.php?wheel_id={id}`
- **Business Management**: `/business/spin-wheel.php?wheel_id={id}`
- **Campaign Creation**: `/business/create-campaign.php`
- **QR Generation**: `/qr-generator.php` (with spin_wheel type)

### QR Code Types
1. **static** - Basic URL QR codes
2. **dynamic** - Dynamic URL QR codes
3. **dynamic_voting** - Campaign voting QR codes
4. **dynamic_vending** - Machine-specific voting QR codes
5. **machine_sales** - Machine sales/promotions QR codes
6. **promotion** - Promotion display QR codes
7. **spin_wheel** - ‚≠ê **NEW** - Direct spin wheel access QR codes

### Spin Wheel Types
1. **campaign** - Associated with specific campaigns
2. **machine** - Associated with specific vending machines
3. **qr_standalone** - Standalone wheels accessed via QR codes

## üîÑ WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

### Campaign Creation Workflow
1. Business creates campaign in `/business/create-campaign.php`
2. Optionally selects spin wheel integration:
   - **None**: No spin wheel
   - **Create New**: Creates new wheel for campaign
   - **Use Existing**: Selects from existing wheels
3. Campaign is created with spin wheel association
4. Spin wheel becomes available for QR code generation

### QR Code Generation Workflow
1. Business accesses `/qr-generator.php`
2. Selects "Spin Wheel QR Code" type
3. Chooses from available spin wheels
4. QR code generates URL: `/public/spin-wheel.php?wheel_id={id}`
5. Users scan QR code and access public spin wheel

### Public User Experience
1. User scans QR code
2. Redirected to `/public/spin-wheel.php?wheel_id={id}`
3. Sees branded spin wheel with business logo/name
4. Spins wheel and wins prizes
5. Results tracked in database for business analytics
