# Sales Database Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the new sales database schema with the `my-catalog.php` and `master-items.php` pages. Both pages now display real sales performance data instead of just suggested prices and basic catalog information.

## Important Database Relationships Fixed

### Issue Found:
The original integration attempted to join `master_items` directly with `sales`, but the actual database structure is:
- `master_items` → `item_mapping` → `items` → `sales`
- `sales` table references `items.id`, not `master_items.id`

### Solution Applied:
Updated both pages to use proper JOIN chain:
```sql
FROM master_items mi
LEFT JOIN item_mapping im ON mi.id = im.master_item_id
LEFT JOIN items i ON im.item_id = i.id AND i.machine_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM machines WHERE business_id = ?
)
LEFT JOIN sales s ON i.id = s.item_id 
    AND s.business_id = ? 
    AND s.sale_time >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
```

### Inventory Data:
Changed from non-existent `inventory` table to using `items.inventory` column directly:
- **Before**: `COALESCE(inv.quantity, 0) as current_stock`  
- **After**: `COALESCE(SUM(i.inventory), 0) as current_stock`

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Integration

#### Tables Used:
- **`sales`** - Real transaction data with `sale_price`, `quantity`, `sale_time`
- **`item_mapping`** - Links `master_items` to `items`
- **`items`** - Machine-specific items with inventory data
- **`machines`** - For business filtering
- **`businesses`** - Business association for sales filtering

#### Key Metrics Calculated:
- **Actual Revenue**: `SUM(s.sale_price * s.quantity)` from last 30 days
- **Units Sold**: `SUM(s.quantity)` from last 30 days  
- **Actual Profit**: `SUM((s.sale_price - cost) * s.quantity)`
- **Average Sale Price**: `AVG(s.sale_price)`
- **Active Days**: `COUNT(DISTINCT DATE(s.sale_time))`
- **Current Stock**: `SUM(i.inventory)` from items table
- **Sales Performance Rating**: Dynamic 1-5 scale based on sales volume

### 2. my-catalog.php Updates

#### Query Changes:
- Fixed JOIN chain: `master_items` → `item_mapping` → `items` → `sales`
- Added business filtering through `machines` table
- Updated performance calculation to use actual sales data
- Added new sort options: `sales_desc` for sorting by units sold

#### Display Enhancements:
- **Performance Rating**: Now calculated from actual sales volume (50+ = 5 stars, 30+ = 4 stars, etc.)
- **Stock Indicators**: Low stock warnings for items ≤ 5 units  
- **Pricing**: Shows both listed price and average actual sale price when different
- **Real Profit**: Displays actual profit from sales vs. theoretical margin
- **Sales Metrics**: 30-day sales count, revenue, and daily averages
- **Performance Context**: "Based on sales volume (30 days)" explanation

#### Statistics Integration:
- Updated summary stats to use real sales data through proper joins
- Fixed aggregation logic for proper totals calculation

### 3. master-items.php Updates

#### Query Changes:
- Fixed JOIN chain: `master_items` → `item_mapping` → `items` → `sales`
- Added business filtering through `machines` table  
- Added GROUP BY clause for proper aggregation
- Added new sort options: `sales_desc`, `revenue_desc`
- Simplified count query for better performance

#### New Columns Added:
- **Sales (30d)**: Shows units sold with daily average
- **Revenue (30d)**: Shows actual revenue with daily average  
- **Stock**: Current inventory with color-coded warnings (red ≤ 5, yellow ≤ 20)

#### Enhanced Display:
- **Sales Performance Badges**: High/Medium/Low seller indicators
- **Stock Warnings**: Visual indicators for low stock items
- **Pricing Comparison**: Shows both suggested and actual average sale prices
- **Profit Tracking**: Displays both theoretical and actual profit margins

#### Header Statistics:
- **Sales (30d)**: Total units sold on current page
- **Revenue (30d)**: Total revenue from displayed items
- **Selling**: Number of items with sales vs. total items
- **Low Stock**: Count of items with ≤ 5 units in stock

### 4. Performance Improvements

#### Correct Business Association:
- Fixed business_id filtering through `machines` table for proper multi-tenant support
- Sales data now correctly filtered per business through item relationships

#### Optimized Queries:
- Proper JOIN relationships prevent data inconsistencies
- Added appropriate business filtering through machine ownership
- Reduced unnecessary data fetching through corrected relationships

### 5. User Experience Enhancements

#### Visual Indicators:
- Color-coded stock levels (red/yellow/green)
- Performance-based star ratings
- Sales performance badges
- Low stock warnings

#### Actionable Data:
- Daily sales averages for trend analysis
- Actual vs. suggested pricing comparison
- Real profit tracking vs. theoretical margins
- Stock level monitoring

## Benefits

1. **Real Performance Data**: Pages now show actual sales performance instead of static suggestions
2. **Inventory Management**: Live stock level monitoring with warnings
3. **Pricing Optimization**: Compare suggested vs. actual sale prices
4. **Profit Tracking**: See real profit margins from actual sales
5. **Business Intelligence**: Daily averages and trends for decision making
6. **Multi-tenant Support**: Properly filtered by business through machine ownership

## Database Requirements

Ensure these tables exist with proper relationships:
- `sales` table with business_id, item_id, sale_price, quantity, sale_time
- `item_mapping` table linking master_items to items
- `items` table with machine_id and inventory column
- `machines` table with business_id for filtering

## Testing Notes

Both files passed PHP syntax validation after the relationship fixes. The integration maintains backward compatibility - if no sales data exists, pages will show zeros rather than breaking.

## Critical Fix Applied

**Problem**: Database query was failing due to incorrect table relationships
**Solution**: Updated JOIN chain to follow proper foreign key relationships:
- `master_items.id` → `item_mapping.master_item_id`
- `item_mapping.item_id` → `items.id`  
- `items.id` → `sales.item_id`

This ensures sales data is properly associated with master items through the correct relationship chain.
