echo "ðŸŽ° SLOT MACHINE VISUAL FIXES TEST\n";
echo "=================================\n\n";

echo "The following fixes have been applied to the slot machine visuals:\n\n";

echo "1. âœ… FIXED: generateSpinResults() now properly creates winning combinations\n";
echo "   - Added generateWinningResults() for intentional wins\n";
echo "   - Added generateLosingResults() to ensure losses look like losses\n";
echo "   - 15% win rate with proper visual matching\n\n";

echo "2. âœ… FIXED: buildFinalReel() now properly marks winning symbols\n";
echo "   - Only marks symbols as 'winning-symbol' when there's an actual win\n";
echo "   - Handles different win types (straight line vs diagonal)\n";
echo "   - Proper visual feedback for all win types\n\n";

echo "3. âœ… FIXED: Glow effects now only apply to winning reels\n";
echo "   - Reels only glow when they contribute to the actual win\n";
echo "   - No more random glowing on non-winning spins\n\n";

echo "4. âœ… IMPROVED: Win type distribution\n";
echo "   - 60% of wins are straight line (3 matching symbols)\n";
echo "   - 20% of wins are rarity line (same rarity, different avatars)\n";
echo "   - 20% of wins are diagonal (matching corners)\n\n";

echo "Expected behavior now:\n";
echo "- When you see 3 identical symbols in a row, they will glow and you'll win\n";
echo "- When you see matching corners (diagonal), those symbols will glow\n";
echo "- When you see 3 symbols of the same rarity, all 3 will glow\n";
echo "- Losing spins will show mismatched symbols with no glow\n";
echo "- The visual display will match the win calculation logic\n\n";

echo "ðŸŽ¯ NEXT STEPS:\n";
echo "1. Test the slot machine in the browser\n";
echo "2. Verify that winning combinations are visually obvious\n";
echo "3. Check that the glow effects match the actual wins\n";
echo "4. Confirm that 3-in-a-row wins show 3 identical symbols\n\n";

echo "Files modified:\n";
echo "- html/casino/js/slot-machine.js (visual display logic)\n";
echo "- Added sophisticated win/loss generation\n";
echo "- Fixed symbol marking and glow effects\n\n";

echo "The slot machine should now provide a much better visual experience!\n";
