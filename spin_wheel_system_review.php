echo "🎡 SPIN WHEEL SYSTEM COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW\n";
echo "==========================================\n\n";

echo "✅ SPIN WHEEL SYSTEM ANALYSIS COMPLETE\n\n";

echo "🔍 ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n";

echo "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #1: FRONTEND/BACKEND MISMATCH\n";
echo "Problem: The frontend spin animation doesn't match backend win determination\n";
echo "Location: html/public/spin-wheel.php lines 456-470\n";
echo "Current Logic:\n";
echo "   - Frontend: Calculates winning segment visually after animation\n";
echo "   - Backend: Uses separate weighted random selection\n";
echo "   - Result: What user sees != what they actually win\n\n";

echo "💡 FIX REQUIRED:\n";
echo "   1. Backend should determine winner FIRST\n";
echo "   2. Frontend should animate TO the predetermined winner\n";
echo "   3. Visual result must match actual reward\n\n";

echo "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE #2: ODDS NOT TRANSPARENT\n";
echo "Problem: Rarity-based odds calculation is unclear\n";
echo "Location: html/public/spin-wheel.php lines 51-65\n";
echo "Current Formula: weight = (11 - rarity_level)\n";
echo "Issues:\n";
echo "   - No clear percentage display for users\n";
echo "   - Weight calculation is confusing\n";
echo "   - No documentation of actual odds\n\n";

echo "💡 ODDS CALCULATION REVIEW:\n";
echo "Rarity Level → Weight → Approx %\n";
echo "   1 (common)     → 10  → ~40%\n";
echo "   3 (uncommon)   → 8   → ~32%\n";
echo "   5 (rare)       → 6   → ~24%\n";
echo "   8 (epic)       → 3   → ~12%\n";
echo "   10 (legendary) → 1   → ~4%\n\n";

echo "❌ ISSUE #3: INCONSISTENT USER NAVIGATION\n";
echo "Found Multiple Access Points:\n";
echo "   1. /html/user/spin.php - User dashboard spin\n";
echo "   2. /html/public/spin-wheel.php - QR code access\n";
echo "   3. Business integration via QR codes\n";
echo "Problem: Different features and restrictions on each\n\n";

echo "❌ ISSUE #4: QR CODE INTEGRATION GAPS\n";
echo "QR Generation: ✅ Working (enhanced-generate.php)\n";
echo "QR Validation: ✅ Working (validateSpinWheel)\n";
echo "QR Redirection: ⚠️  Needs verification\n";
echo "Business Setup: ⚠️  Complex setup process\n\n";

echo "🎯 DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS:\n\n";

echo "1. 🖥️  USER NAVIGATION FLOW:\n";
echo "   Entry Points:\n";
echo "   ✅ Business Dashboard → Create Spin Wheel\n";
echo "   ✅ Generate QR Code → Link to Spin Wheel\n";
echo "   ✅ User Scans QR → Public Spin Page\n";
echo "   ✅ Logged Users → User Spin Dashboard\n\n";

echo "2. 🏢 BUSINESS QR CODE INTEGRATION:\n";
echo "   Setup Process:\n";
echo "   ✅ Create spin wheel in business dashboard\n";
echo "   ✅ Add rewards with rarity levels\n";
echo "   ✅ Generate QR code linking to wheel\n";
echo "   ⚠️  No clear instructions for businesses\n";
echo "   ⚠️  Reward management could be simpler\n\n";

echo "3. 🎲 ODDS & FAIRNESS ANALYSIS:\n";
echo "   Backend Calculation (public spin):\n";
echo "   ```php\n";
echo "   foreach (rewards as reward) {\n";
echo "       totalWeight += (11 - reward['rarity_level']);\n";
echo "   }\n";
echo "   randomWeight = mt_rand(1, totalWeight);\n";
echo "   ```\n";
echo "   \n";
echo "   Issues:\n";
echo "   ❌ No minimum/maximum win rates enforced\n";
echo "   ❌ No prevention of consecutive wins\n";
echo "   ❌ No house edge consideration\n";
echo "   ❌ Weights could be gaming-friendly\n\n";

echo "4. 🏆 WIN ACCURACY PROBLEMS:\n";
echo "   Current Frontend Logic:\n";
echo "   ```javascript\n";
echo "   const winningIndex = Math.floor(\n";
echo "       (2 * Math.PI - normalizedRotation) / anglePerSegment\n";
echo "   ) % rewards.length;\n";
echo "   ```\n";
echo "   \n";
echo "   Backend Logic:\n";
echo "   ```php\n";
echo "   // Separate weighted random selection\n";
echo "   if (randomWeight <= currentWeight) {\n";
echo "       selectedReward = reward;\n";
echo "   }\n";
echo "   ```\n";
echo "   \n";
echo "   Result: FRONTEND ≠ BACKEND WINNER\n\n";

echo "🛠️  SPECIFIC FIXES NEEDED:\n\n";

echo "FIX #1: SYNCHRONIZE FRONTEND & BACKEND\n";
echo "   Step 1: Backend determines winner first\n";
echo "   Step 2: Frontend calculates target angle for winner\n";
echo "   Step 3: Spin animation ends at correct segment\n";
echo "   Code Changes Needed:\n";
echo "   - Modify submitSpinResult() to get winner before animation\n";
echo "   - Add targetAngle calculation in frontend\n";
echo "   - Ensure spin stops at predetermined result\n\n";

echo "FIX #2: IMPROVE ODDS TRANSPARENCY\n";
echo "   - Display percentage chances for each reward\n";
echo "   - Add 'View Odds' button for users\n";
echo "   - Implement configurable house edge\n";
echo "   - Add minimum/maximum win rate limits\n\n";

echo "FIX #3: STANDARDIZE NAVIGATION\n";
echo "   - Unify spin limitations across all access points\n";
echo "   - Consistent user experience regardless of entry\n";
echo "   - Clear separation of public vs. user-specific features\n\n";

echo "FIX #4: ENHANCE QR INTEGRATION\n";
echo "   - Add business setup wizard\n";
echo "   - Improve QR code testing tools\n";
echo "   - Better documentation for businesses\n";
echo "   - Simplified reward management interface\n\n";

echo "🧪 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n";

echo "1. Win Accuracy Test:\n";
echo "   - Spin 100 times\n";
echo "   - Record frontend visual winner\n";
echo "   - Compare with backend awarded prize\n";
echo "   - Should be 100% match rate\n\n";

echo "2. Odds Verification:\n";
echo "   - Spin 1000 times for each rarity level\n";
echo "   - Calculate actual win percentages\n";
echo "   - Compare with theoretical odds\n";
echo "   - Variance should be < 5%\n\n";

echo "3. QR Code Flow Test:\n";
echo "   - Generate QR for spin wheel\n";
echo "   - Scan with different devices\n";
echo "   - Verify redirect works\n";
echo "   - Test with/without login\n\n";

echo "4. Multi-User Fairness:\n";
echo "   - Test with multiple concurrent users\n";
echo "   - Verify no interference between spins\n";
echo "   - Check cooldown enforcement\n";
echo "   - Validate reward distribution\n\n";

echo "⚠️  IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:\n\n";
echo "🔴 CRITICAL (Fix Immediately):\n";
echo "   1. Fix frontend/backend winner mismatch\n";
echo "   2. Ensure visual spin matches actual reward\n\n";

echo "🟡 HIGH PRIORITY (Fix This Week):\n";
echo "   3. Add odds transparency\n";
echo "   4. Improve business setup process\n";
echo "   5. Standardize navigation flow\n\n";

echo "🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Fix This Month):\n";
echo "   6. Enhanced testing tools\n";
echo "   7. Better documentation\n";
echo "   8. Performance optimizations\n\n";

echo "📊 CURRENT SYSTEM RATING:\n";
echo "   Functionality: 7/10 (works but has issues)\n";
echo "   Fairness: 4/10 (visual != actual results)\n";
echo "   User Experience: 6/10 (confusing navigation)\n";
echo "   Business Integration: 7/10 (complex but functional)\n";
echo "   Overall: 6/10 (needs significant improvements)\n\n";

echo "✅ The spin wheel system works but needs critical fixes for fairness and accuracy!\n";
echo "Priority should be ensuring visual results match actual rewards. 🎡✨\n";
