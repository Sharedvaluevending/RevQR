# Mobile Desktop Layout Fixes - Real Solutions

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### üîç Issue 1: Discount QR Codes "Greying Out"
**Problem**: Users couldn't access QR codes for expired/redeemed discounts, making them appear "greyed out" and unusable.

**Root Cause**: The conditional logic in `my-discount-qr-codes.php` only allowed QR code interaction for `active` status discounts.

**Real Fix Applied**:
- Made ALL QR codes clickable regardless of status
- Used `opacity-75` instead of `opacity-50` for better visibility  
- Updated click text to indicate status ("Tap to view (expired)")
- Enhanced modal instructions to clarify when codes are for reference only

**Files Modified**:
- `html/user/my-discount-qr-codes.php` (lines 340-380, 520-540)

### üîç Issue 2: Layout "Pushed Left" on Mobile Desktop Mode
**Problem**: Content was being forced to the left side of the screen in mobile desktop mode due to aggressive flexbox centering.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Global CSS bandaid fix was forcing Bootstrap behavior incorrectly
2. `justify-content-between` combined with mobile constraints caused left-alignment
3. Over-aggressive container max-width restrictions

**Real Fix Applied**:
1. **Removed Bandaid Fix**: Eliminated the global "GLOBAL FIX" CSS that was forcing Bootstrap behavior
2. **Targeted Fix**: Added specific CSS targeting only problematic flexbox layouts
3. **Natural Bootstrap**: Let Bootstrap grid system work as designed
4. **Smart Media Queries**: Used device-specific queries for mobile desktop mode

**Files Modified**:
- `html/core/includes/header.php` (lines 861-902) - Replaced bandaid with targeted fix
- `html/user/my-discount-qr-codes.php` (lines 185-200) - Added page-specific fix

## Technical Details

### Before (Bandaid Approach):
```css
/* GLOBAL FIX: Force Bootstrap behavior everywhere */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
    .container, .container-fluid {
        max-width: 1200px !important;
        width: 100% !important;
        /* ... forcing ALL containers */
    }
    .row { /* ... forcing ALL rows */ }
    [class*="col-"] { /* ... forcing ALL columns */ }
}
```

### After (Proper Fix):
```css
/* PROPER FIX: Target specific issues only */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) and (orientation: landscape) {
    /* Fix specific flexbox alignment issues */
    .d-flex.justify-content-between:not(.navbar-brand):not(.pagination) {
        justify-content: flex-start !important;
        gap: 2rem;
    }
    /* Let Bootstrap grid work naturally */
}
```

## Results

1. **QR Code Accessibility**: All discount codes now clickable with clear status indication

3. **Bootstrap Compatibility**: Grid system works naturally without forced overrides
4. **Performance**: Reduced CSS specificity and removed !important overuse

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

## Testing Recommendations

Test on these specific scenarios:
1. **Mobile Portrait**: Standard mobile view
2. **Mobile Landscape**: Mobile desktop mode (the main issue)
3. **Tablet Portrait**: iPad-style viewing
4. **Tablet Landscape**: Desktop-like experience on tablets
5. **Discount Status**: Test active, expired, and redeemed codes

## Future Prevention

To avoid similar issues:
1. Use targeted CSS fixes instead of global overrides
2. Test on actual mobile devices in desktop mode
3. Preserve Bootstrap's natural behavior when possible
4. Use semantic CSS selectors rather than forcing layout
