echo "🎰 SLOT MACHINE SPIN FIX VERIFICATION\n";
echo "=====================================\n\n";

echo "✅ ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:\n\n";

echo "🐛 PROBLEM:\n";
echo "   - JavaScript code was looking for: document.getElementById('betAmount')\n";
echo "   - HTML structure uses: <input name=\"betAmount\" ...> (radio buttons)\n";
echo "   - This caused the spin function to fail when trying to get bet amount\n\n";

echo "🔧 SOLUTION APPLIED:\n";
echo "   - Changed from: getElementById('betAmount').value\n";
echo "   - To: Loop through radio buttons with name='betAmount' to find checked value\n";
echo "   - Added default bet amount of 1 coin as fallback\n\n";

echo "💡 THE FIX:\n";
echo "   Before:\n";
echo "   ```javascript\n";
echo "   const betAmount = parseInt(document.getElementById('betAmount').value);\n";
echo "   ```\n\n";
echo "   After:\n";
echo "   ```javascript\n";
echo "   // Get selected bet amount from radio buttons\n";
echo "   let betAmount = 1; // Default bet\n";
echo "   const betInputs = document.querySelectorAll('input[name=\"betAmount\"]');\n";
echo "   betInputs.forEach(input => {\n";
echo "       if (input.checked) {\n";
echo "           betAmount = parseInt(input.value);\n";
echo "       }\n";
echo "   });\n";
echo "   ```\n\n";

echo "🧪 TO TEST THE FIX:\n\n";
echo "1. Open the slot machine in your browser\n";
echo "2. Select a bet amount (1, 5, or 10 coins)\n";
echo "3. Click the SPIN button\n";
echo "4. The slot machine should now spin properly!\n\n";

echo "✅ EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:\n";
echo "   - Spin button should respond immediately when clicked\n";
echo "   - Slot reels should start spinning animation\n";
echo "   - Game should complete the spin sequence\n";
echo "   - Win/loss results should be calculated correctly\n";
echo "   - Balance should update properly\n\n";

echo "🚨 WHAT TO WATCH FOR:\n";
echo "   - If spin still doesn't work, check browser console for errors\n";
echo "   - Make sure you have sufficient QR coin balance\n";
echo "   - Ensure you have remaining spins for the day\n";
echo "   - Check if the slot machine images are loading properly\n\n";

echo "🎯 TECHNICAL DETAILS:\n";
echo "   - The issue was in: /html/casino/js/slot-machine.js line ~367\n";
echo "   - Fixed the bet amount retrieval in the spin() function\n";
echo "   - This fix maintains compatibility with the existing HTML structure\n";
echo "   - No changes needed to the radio button setup in the HTML\n\n";

echo "The slot machine should now work correctly! 🎰✨\n";
