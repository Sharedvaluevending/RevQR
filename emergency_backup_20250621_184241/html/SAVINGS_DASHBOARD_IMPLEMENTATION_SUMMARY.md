# ðŸ’° Savings Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented QR coin savings tracking in the user dashboard, showing both QR coins invested and CAD dollars saved through discount purchases.

## âœ… Implementation Details

### 1. Database Integration
- **Business Purchases**: Tracks purchases from `business_purchases` table
- **Store Purchases**: Tracks purchases from `user_store_purchases` table  
- **Calculation**: `discount_amount = (regular_price_cents Ã— discount_percentage / 100)`
- **Currency**: Automatically converts cents to CAD dollars

### 2. Data Tracked
- **Total QR Coins Used**: Sum of all QR coins spent on discounts
- **Total Savings (CAD)**: Total discount value in Canadian dollars
- **Purchase Count**: Number of discount purchases made
- **Redeemed Savings**: Value of discounts already used
- **Pending Savings**: Value of discounts not yet redeemed

### 3. Files Modified

#### Core Implementation
- `html/user/dashboard.php` - Added savings calculation and display section

#### Calculation Logic Added
```php
// Get user's discount savings (both QR coins and CAD value)
$savings_data = [
    'total_qr_coins_used' => 0,
    'total_savings_cad' => 0.00,
    'total_purchases' => 0,
    'redeemed_savings_cad' => 0.00,
    'pending_savings_cad' => 0.00
];

// Query both business_purchases and user_store_purchases tables
// Calculate total savings in CAD and QR coins used
```

### 4. Dashboard Display

#### Left Card: Total Savings
- **Primary Display**: Total savings in CAD (e.g., "$2.10 CAD")
- **Secondary Info**: QR coins invested (e.g., "264 QR coins invested")
- **Icon**: Piggy bank icon
- **Color**: Success green gradient

#### Right Card: Savings Breakdown
- **Redeemed Section**: Shows already used discounts
- **Pending Section**: Shows available discounts
- **Footer**: Total number of discount purchases
- **Color**: Dark gradient with colored icons

## ðŸ“Š Sample Data

### Real User Example (User ID 2)

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### For Users
1. **Purchase Discounts**: Users spend QR coins to buy discount codes
2. **Track Savings**: System calculates real CAD value of discounts
3. **View Dashboard**: Users see total savings and investment
4. **Redeem Discounts**: Use codes at vending machines
5. **Monitor Status**: Track redeemed vs pending savings

### Calculation Formula
```
Discount Value (CAD) = (Item Regular Price Ã— Discount Percentage) / 100
Total Savings = Sum of all discount values
QR Coins Used = Sum of all QR coins spent on discounts
```
