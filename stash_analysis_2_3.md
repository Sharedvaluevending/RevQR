# STASH@{2} AND STASH@{3} ANALYSIS

## STASH@{2} - "WIP on main: ec94528 Initial commit"
- **Hash**: `9029cd9088c4d8d84571d10c1bf585bcd0801896`
- **Created**: 1749892571 -0400 (during main branch work)
- **Context**: Work in progress on main branch
- **Timing**: Created during early development phase
- **Assessment**: Likely contains basic setup work or early features

## STASH@{3} - "WIP on feature/bug-bot: 74de6c8 Commit all changes before creating QR Code 2.02 branch"
- **Hash**: `0c8fc116e991a85293cd2d7bde9fa71042ebf419`  
- **Created**: 1749892454 -0400 (right before QR Code 2.02 branch creation)
- **Context**: Work in progress on feature/bug-bot branch
- **Timing**: Created AFTER commit 74de6c8 "Commit all changes before creating QR Code 2.02 branch"
- **Assessment**: ⚠️ **POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT** - Contains work that was in progress when QR Code 2.02 branch was created

## KEY INSIGHTS

### STASH@{3} IS CRITICAL
This stash was created right after you committed "all changes before creating QR Code 2.02 branch" but BEFORE actually creating the branch. This suggests:

1. **Uncommitted Work**: There were additional changes made after the "final" commit
2. **QR Code 2.02 Features**: Could contain specific features intended for version 2.02
3. **Bug Fixes**: Might contain important bug fixes that weren't included in the commit
4. **Enhanced Features**: Could have additional enhancements to the QR system

### RECOVERY RECOMMENDATION
**STASH@{3}** should be examined and potentially applied because:
- It was created at a critical juncture (right before QR Code 2.02 branch)
- The timing suggests it contains work that was meant to be part of version 2.02
- It represents work that was in progress but not committed

### STASH@{2} ASSESSMENT
**STASH@{2}** is likely less critical as it was created during early main branch work, but could contain:
- Early feature implementations
- Initial setup configurations
- Basic functionality that might have been refined later

## NEXT STEPS
1. **Priority 1**: Apply/examine STASH@{3} - likely contains QR Code 2.02 specific work
2. **Priority 2**: Check STASH@{2} for any foundational work that might be missing
3. **Verify**: Ensure no important features are lost from these stashes
