# Voting System Review Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive review of the voting system, including vote recording, coin rewards, balance updates, and link functionality.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Critical QR Coin Transaction Bug ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: The voting system was calling `QRCoinManager::addTransaction()` with incorrect parameter order.
- **Before**: `QRCoinManager::addTransaction($user_id, 30, 'Vote cast for item', 'vote')`
- **After**: `QRCoinManager::addTransaction($user_id, 'earning', 'voting', 30, 'Vote cast for item')`

**Files Fixed**:
- `html/vote.php` (line ~480)
- `html/public/vote.php` (line ~240)

**Impact**: This was preventing QR coins from being awarded to users when they voted.

### 2. Navigation Link Issues ✅ FIXED
**Issue**: Navigation links were pointing to incorrect vote page locations.
- **Before**: `/user/vote.php` and `/user/voting.php`
- **After**: `/vote.php` (correct main voting page)

**Files Fixed**:
- `html/core/includes/navbar.php`
- `html/includes/user_nav.php`

**Impact**: Users couldn't access the voting page through navigation menus.
