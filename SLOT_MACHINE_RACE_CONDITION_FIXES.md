# QR Slot Machine Race Condition Fixes

## Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. **Database Race Conditions** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem**: Multiple concurrent requests could modify user balance or spin counts simultaneously, leading to:
- Double spending of coins
- Incorrect balance calculations  
- Spin count desynchronization
- Lost transactions

**Fix Applied**: Added row-level locking in `html/api/casino/record-play.php`
```php
// Lock user's balance calculation
SELECT user_id FROM qr_coin_transactions 
WHERE user_id = ? ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE

// Lock user's daily limits  
SELECT user_id FROM casino_daily_limits 
WHERE user_id = ? AND business_id = ? AND play_date = CURDATE() FOR UPDATE
```

**Result**: Prevents concurrent balance modifications during transaction processing.

### 2. **Client-Side Double-Click Prevention** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY  
**Problem**: Rapid clicking could trigger multiple simultaneous spins, causing:
- Multiple API calls for single user action
- Unexpected balance deductions
- Animation conflicts

**Fix Applied**: Added timestamp-based prevention in `html/casino/js/slot-machine.js`
```javascript
// Track last spin time
this.lastSpinTime = 0;

// Prevent spins within 1 second of each other
const now = Date.now();
if (this.lastSpinTime && (now - this.lastSpinTime) < 1000) {
    console.log('üö´ Spin blocked - too soon after last spin');
    return;
}
this.lastSpinTime = now;
```

**Result**: Eliminates rapid-fire spin attempts.

### 3. **Enhanced Pre-Validation** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: Expensive animations started before server validation, causing:
- Poor user experience on validation failures
- Wasted processing on invalid requests

**Fix Applied**: Added early validation before animations
```javascript
// Pre-validate before starting expensive animations
if (betAmount > this.currentBalance) {
    this.isSpinning = false;
    this.updateSpinButton(); 
    this.showError('Insufficient balance for this bet amount');
    return;
}

if (this.spinsRemaining !== null && this.spinsRemaining <= 0) {
    this.isSpinning = false;
    this.updateSpinButton();
    this.showError('No spins remaining. Purchase spin packs to continue.');
    return;
}
```

**Result**: Better user experience and reduced server load.

### 4. **Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff** ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: Network failures or temporary server issues caused complete transaction loss
- Users lost coins without getting play results
- No recovery mechanism for temporary failures  

**Fix Applied**: Added intelligent retry system
```javascript
const maxRetries = 3;
let retryCount = 0;

// Don't retry authentication or validation errors
if (error.message.includes('Authentication') ||
    error.message.includes('Insufficient') ||
    error.message.includes('No casino spins')) {
    this.showError(error.message);
    return;
}

// Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays
const delayMs = Math.pow(2, retryCount - 1) * 1000;
```

**Result**: Improved reliability for temporary network issues.

### 5. **Optimistic Balance Recovery** ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW PRIORITY
**Problem**: When all retries fail, user uncertain if coins were deducted
- Poor user experience during network outages
- Potential customer service issues

**Fix Applied**: Optimistic balance restoration on complete failure
```javascript
// Try to restore user's balance optimistically
// Since we don't know if server processed the bet or not,
// we'll assume it didn't and restore the balance
this.currentBalance += betAmount;
this.updateBalance();
console.log('üîÑ Optimistically restored', betAmount, 'coins due to connection failure');
```

**Result**: Better user experience during network failures.

## Testing Recommendations

### High Priority Tests:
1. **Concurrent User Testing**: Multiple users spinning simultaneously at same business
2. **Network Interruption**: Disconnect during spin processing  
3. **Database Load**: High concurrent transaction volume
4. **Rapid Clicking**: Automated fast clicking on spin button

### Medium Priority Tests:
5. **Balance Edge Cases**: Exact balance amounts, insufficient funds
6. **Spin Pack Expiration**: Edge cases around spin pack timing
7. **Browser Refresh**: Mid-transaction page refresh scenarios

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Server-Side Logging:
- Row lock acquisition times
- Transaction rollback frequency  
- Concurrent request patterns
- Balance calculation discrepancies

### Client-Side Logging:
- Double-click prevention triggers
- Retry attempt frequencies
- Balance restoration events
- Network failure patterns

## Deployment Notes

### Database Impact:
- Row-level locking may slightly increase transaction times
- Monitor for deadlock scenarios under high load
- Consider connection pool sizing for lock duration

### Client Impact:  
- Minimal performance impact from validation checks
- Improved user experience from better error handling
- Reduced unnecessary server requests

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the critical changes can be rolled back by:
1. Removing FOR UPDATE clauses from casino record-play.php
2. Reverting spin() method to original version
3. Disabling retry logic in recordPlay() method

**Files Modified:**
- `html/api/casino/record-play.php` - Database locking and atomic validation
- `html/casino/js/slot-machine.js` - Client-side prevention and retry logic

**Risk Assessment**: LOW - Changes are backwards compatible and fail safely.
