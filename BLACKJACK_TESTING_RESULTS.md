# üÉè Blackjack Testing Results & Fixes

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ **Critical JavaScript Syntax Error**
- **Problem**: Dangling object literal in `initializeGame()` function causing JavaScript to fail completely
- **Fix**: Added missing `console.log()` statement
- **Impact**: This was preventing the entire blackjack game from initializing

### 2. ‚úÖ **Deprecated API Endpoint**
- **Problem**: JavaScript was calling the deprecated `/api/casino/record-play.php` which returns security errors
- **Fix**: Updated to use `/api/casino/simple-record-play.php` 
- **Impact**: Coin transactions now work properly

### 3. ‚úÖ **Business ID Null Issue**
- **Problem**: When no casino businesses were available, `business_id` was set to `null`, breaking JavaScript
- **Fix**: Default to `business_id = 1` for general casino mode
- **Impact**: Blackjack now works even without specific business locations

### 4. ‚úÖ **Navigation Integration**
- **Added**: Blackjack link in the Play dropdown menu
- **Added**: Prominent blackjack section on casino main page
- **Impact**: Users can now easily find and access blackjack
